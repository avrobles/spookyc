# The Spooky Programming Language ðŸ‘»

At the bleeding edge of programming language research, theoreticians structure problems intractable for the retention of the mental contex of a single human mind into explicit semantics, their efforts weighted across the axis of expressiveness.

Among these computations determined too onerous for more affable turing machines, memory management has thrived in the zeitgeist, with such implementations as rust and ATS holding court upon many a Hacker News thread. Distributed systems are no less favored, with Erlang and Ponylang side projects blooming increasingly lush in Github's harvest season.

But there is one clade of computational semantics that remains too labyrinthine, too daring for the eye of even our most maverick programming language academics: writing spooky programs.

Until now.

Introducing:

_ðŸŽƒ The Spooky Programming Language ðŸŽƒ_

# The Programming Language of Fear ðŸŒš

Spookylang stands behind but one goal: to be the scariest programming language. Yes, I know, "What about Java 7?!" as you wheel around to high-five your coworker. Enough merriment.

In order to write Spookylang, our primary researcher first had to truly understand the meaning of fear. Failing to do that, our researcher instead proposed these language features:

## Spooky-Completeness ðŸ˜ˆ

Simply put, Spookylang is a machine that can be programmed to execute any computable functions that take "scary" input and output "spooky" output. This property (henceforth referred to as Spooky completeness) is isomorphic to Turing completeness by way of the following reversible morphisms:

```
let n be any string 
let ðŸ¤¡ be any spooky string
let ðŸŽƒ be a scary word

N + ðŸŽƒ -> ðŸ¤¡
ðŸ¤¡ - ðŸŽƒ -> N
```

To enforce this invariant, the Spookylang interpreter provides I/O routines that crash upon being passed "non-scary" strings.

## Determining scariness of strings ðŸ’€

The problem of binary categorization of arbitrary input is well known to the artificial intelligence community. For our own purposes, we employed an "AI list of regular expressions" that clusters strings according to the following policy:

## It is not enough that our strings be scary, so too must our variables ðŸ‘¹

In a good program, variable names must be terse, but expressive.

In Spookylang they must also be scary.

## The spookiest emojis ðŸ˜±

There's nothing less scary than a keyword.

.. Except in Spookylang where all keywords are spooky emojis!
